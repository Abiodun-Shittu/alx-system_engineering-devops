# 0x19. Postmortem

## Tasks
### 0. My first postmortem
- Using one of the web stack debugging project issue or an outage you have personally face, write a postmortem. Most of you will never have faced an outage, so just get creative and invent your own :)

### 1. Make people want to read your postmortem
