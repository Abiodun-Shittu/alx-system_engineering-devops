# 0x10. HTTPS SSL

## Tasks
### 0. World wide web
- Configure your domain zone so that the subdomain www points to your load-balancer IP (lb-01). Letâ€™s also add other subdomains to make our life easier, and write a Bash script that will display information about subdomains.

### 1. HAproxy SSL termination
- Create a certificate using certbot and configure HAproxy to accept encrypted traffic for your subdomain www..

### 2. No loophole in your website traffic
- A good habit is to enforce HTTPS traffic so that no unencrypted traffic is possible. Configure HAproxy to automatically redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
