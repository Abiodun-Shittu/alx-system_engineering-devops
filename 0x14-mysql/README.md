# 0x14. MySQL

## Tasks
### 0. Install MySQL
- First things first, letâ€™s get MySQL installed on both your web-01 and web-02 servers.

### 1. Let us in!
- In order for us to verify that your servers are properly configured, we need you to create a user and password for both MySQL databases which will allow the checker access to them.

### 3. Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it?
- Before you get started with your primary-replica synchronization, you need one more thing in place. On your primary MySQL server (web-01), create a new user for the replica server.

### 4. Setup a Primary-Replica infrastructure using MySQL

### 5. MySQL backup
